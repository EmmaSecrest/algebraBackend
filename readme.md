# Algebraic Calculator Backend

## Purpose

This project is a versatile algebraic calculator capable of solving equations of various complexities. Whether it's linear equations, quadratic equations, or polynomial equations, our calculator is designed to handle them all.

## Progress

This project is in project and is not yet complete. Right now the program can handle functions in the form of *y = mx + b* or *ax^2 + bx + c = 0*. My next step is to handle higher level functions.

## Testing

This project is equipped with Pythons in house testing library.

Before running the test library please install all the needed libraries using this script:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the tests please use the following script:

```
python -m unittest discover
```
